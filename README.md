# Comparation Project of 2 Classification Model for Multiclass Image Classification
A deep learning project that classifies natural disaster images into four categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **EfficientNet-B0**.  
Built for Deep Learning Final Project at BINUS University.


## Main Objective
To compare the performance of a **custom CNN** and **EfficientNet-B0** in identifying natural disaster such as:
- Earthquake  
- Urban Fire  
- Landslide  
- Water Disaster  

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. CNN model design and tuning  
3. Transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0  
4. Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Result Summary
| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Custom CNN | ~9% | Overfitting, unstable |
| CLRKModel V2 | Improved | Better regularization |
| EfficientNet-B0 | ‚≠ê Best | High accuracy, well-generalized |

**EfficientNet-B0** achieved the best balance between performance and efficiency through transfer learning.
